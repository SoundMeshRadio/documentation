:::accordion-item{label="What is SoundMesh and how is it different from music bots?" icon="i-lucide-circle-help"}
SoundMesh is a professional live radio broadcasting platform, not just another music bot. While music bots play pre-recorded tracks, SoundMesh enables real DJs to broadcast live shows, create scheduled programming, and build actual radio stations for your community. Think of it as the difference between a playlist and a real radio station with live personalities.
:::

:::accordion-item{label="Do I need special equipment to broadcast?" icon="i-lucide-circle-help"}
Not at all! You can start broadcasting with just your computer and a microphone. Our web broadcaster works directly in your browser. For more advanced setups, we support OBS, professional mixing software, and dedicated streaming encoders. Start simple and upgrade as you grow!
:::

:::accordion-item{label="How much does SoundMesh cost?" icon="i-lucide-circle-help"}
We offer a generous free tier perfect for getting started and testing. Free accounts include 1 station, up to 10 concurrent listeners. Our paid plans give higher limits to expand your station network. If you don't wan't to upgrade plans, you can instead buy indvidual addons. Check our [pricing page](https://soundmesh.dev/pricing) for all options.

:::accordion-item{label="Can I use SoundMesh with my FiveM server?" icon="i-lucide-circle-help"}
Absolutely! We have a dedicated FiveM resource that integrates seamlessly with your server. Players can listen to radio stations in vehicles, and with our upcoming DJ job system, they can even become radio DJs as an actual in-game career. We support both QBCore and ESX frameworks.
:::

:::accordion-item{label="How do I integrate SoundMesh with Discord?" icon="i-lucide-circle-help"}
Super easy! Just invite our Discord bot to your server and link it to your SoundMesh account. The bot can stream your stations into voice channels and show what's currently playing. Our upcoming voice channel broadcasting bot will let you go live directly from Discord!
:::

:::accordion-item{label="What's the audio quality like?" icon="i-lucide-circle-help"}
We support multiple quality levels: 96kbps (free tier), 192kbps, 256kbps, and 320kbps (paid plans).
:::

:::accordion-item{label="Can multiple DJs share a station?" icon="i-lucide-circle-help"}
Yes! Station owners can invite unlimited DJs to their stations. You can set up schedules, assign time slots, and manage permissions. Perfect for building a team of DJs with different shows throughout the day. Each DJ gets their own login and broadcasting credentials.
:::

:::accordion-item{label="Is there a limit on how long I can broadcast?" icon="i-lucide-circle-help"}
No limits! Broadcast 24/7 if you want. Some stations run automated playlists during off-hours and go live for special shows. Others have DJs covering different time zones for round-the-clock live programming. It's completely up to you!
:::

:::accordion-item{label="Can I monetize my radio station?" icon="i-lucide-circle-help"}
While we don't handle monetization directly, you're free to monetize your station through sponsorships, donations, or in-game mechanics (for RP servers). Many FiveM servers tie radio advertising to their in-game economy.
:::

:::accordion-item{label="What about music licensing and copyright?" icon="i-lucide-circle-help"}
You're responsible for ensuring you have the right to broadcast any content on your station. We recommend using royalty-free music, obtaining proper licenses, or focusing on talk radio/podcast content. For RP servers, many DJs do live mixing, talk shows, or use copyright-free music libraries.

For stations that want to play licensed music legally, we include built-in reporting tools that help you comply with [SoundExchange reporting requirements](https://www.soundexchange.com/service-provider/reporting-requirements/). Our system automatically tracks what you play and generates the necessary reports for statutory licensing compliance. This makes it easier to do things by the book!
:::

:::accordion-item{label="Can I import my existing playlist from YouTube?" icon="i-lucide-circle-help"}
SoundMesh is designed for live broadcasting, not playlist playback. However, your station includes storage allowing you to upload your own music files.
:::

:::accordion-item{label="How reliable is the service?" icon="i-lucide-circle-help"}
We strive to maintain 99.9% uptime and report any maintenance windows ahead of time. We are currently expanding our services across multiple regions to provide low latency streams for communities based anywhere.
:::

:::accordion-item{label="What's the deal with frequencies and FM/AM?" icon="i-lucide-circle-help"}
These are cosmetic features designed to enhance immersion, especially for RP servers! Players can "tune in" to different frequencies in-game, making the experience feel more realistic. The frequency you choose doesn't affect actual broadcasting (yet) - it's all about the roleplay experience.
:::

:::accordion-item{label="I need help! Where can I get support?" icon="i-lucide-circle-help"}
We've got you covered! Free users can get help in our [Discord community](https://chat.soundmesh.dev). Paid users get access to priority discord ticket support or can call our support line. Our docs are also comprehensive and constantly updated!
