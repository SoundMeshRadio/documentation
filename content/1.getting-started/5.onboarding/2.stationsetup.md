After creating your first server during our onboarding process, you'll immediately set up your first radio station. This station is attached to the server you just created, keeping everything organized.

::tip
Don't worry about being locked into one platform! Your server and stations can be used across ANY integration - this selection just helps us optimize your initial setup.
::

### Basic Information:

**Station Name**: The display name for your radio station (e.g., "Rock FM", "Jazz 88.1", "Night City Radio")

**Genre**: Define your station's music style (e.g., "Rock, Pop, Jazz, etc."). This helps listeners know what to expect.

**Description**: Write a brief description of your radio station. What makes it unique? What kind of content will you broadcast?

### Technical Configuration

**Frequency**: Choose a frequency number for immersion (e.g., "88.1", "107.5"). This is especially cool for RP servers where players can "tune in" to different frequencies.

**Modulation**: Select FM or AM. This is purely aesthetic but adds to the realism!

**Server**: This will be pre-selected as the server you just created.

**Short Name**: This is your unique identifier in the SoundMesh system (like a username). It must be:
- 15 characters max
- Letters, numbers, hyphens, lowercase and underscores only
- Globally unique across all SoundMesh stations

::warning
Choose your short name carefully - it cannot be changed later! Think of it like choosing a domain name. If you have issues creating a station, this is probably not unique!
::

**Stream URL**: Add your radio station's website or community URL (optional). This could be your Discord invite, game server website, or any link you want associated with the station.

### Station Logo (Optional)

Upload a logo for your radio station. Recommended size: 256x256px, max file size: 5MB. This will be displayed in-game and on player interfaces.

## What Happens Next?

Once you click "Create Station", you'll be taken to your dashboard where you can:

1. **Get your API credentials** - For game/discord integration
2. **Quick Overiew** - See a glimpse of your acount info and current limits.
3. **System Statius** - You can quickly find the status for the SoundMesh platform

## Quick Tips

- **Multiple Stations**: You can create multiple stations up to your plans limit! This is great for multiple communities or creating genre based stations!
- **Cross-Platform**: Remember, even if you selected "FiveM" as your game, you can still use your stations in Discord, on the web, or any other integration
