### Creating a New Playlist

1. Go to **Playlists** in the sidebar
2. Click **Add Playlist**
3. Configure these settings:

**Basic Settings:**
- **Name**: Give it a descriptive name (e.g., "Daytime Mix", "Rock Rotation")
- **Weight**: How often this playlist plays (explained below)
- **Type**: Choose "General Rotation" for now

### Understanding Playlist Weights

Weights determine how often playlists play relative to each other:

| Example Setup | Weight | Play Frequency |
|--------------|--------|----------------|
| Rock Playlist | 3 | Plays 3 out of 7 songs |
| Pop Playlist | 2 | Plays 2 out of 7 songs |
| Jazz Playlist | 2 | Plays 2 out of 7 songs |

::tip
Higher weight = plays more often. Start simple with one playlist at weight 1, then expand!
