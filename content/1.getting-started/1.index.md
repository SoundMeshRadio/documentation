## Key Features

SoundMesh transforms your server into a living, breathing world with its own radio culture:

- **Live Broadcasting**: Real DJs, real shows, real community interaction
- **Game-Reactive Audio**: Streams that respond to in-game events via our API
- **Multi-Station Support**: Run multiple radio stations with different vibes
- **DJ Management System**: Tools for scheduling, permissions, and show management
- **Curated Playlists**: Move beyond random shuffles to thoughtfully crafted experiences
- **Interactive Shows**: Let listeners request songs, shout-outs, and participate live
- **Professional Mixing**: Crossfade, voice-overs, and live mixing capabilities
- **Stream Analytics**: See what your community loves and when they're listening

## Beyond Background Music

Imagine this: A player enters a nightclub in your RP server and the radio automatically switches to the club's live DJ. Drive through different neighborhoods and experience their unique radio stations. Have actual radio personalities that become part of your server's culture. 

This isn't just background music - it's world-building through sound.

Your community can:
- Host morning shows with news and weather for your RP city
- Run late-night jazz stations for the night owls
- Create faction-specific stations with their own style
- Have DJ battles and live events
- Build actual radio careers within your game

## Built for Immersion

We built SoundMesh because we saw servers struggling with YouTube playlists and basic music bots that broke immersion. Real cities have radio. Real communities have DJs. Why shouldn't yours?

With our API, developers can:
- Sync radio stations to in-game car radios
- Create location-based audio zones
- Trigger special broadcasts for server events
- Build DJ booth interfaces in-game
- Track listener stats for RP business mechanics

Stop settling for shuffle. Start broadcasting.
