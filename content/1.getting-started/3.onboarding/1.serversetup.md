When you first sign in to SoundMesh, you'll be greeted with our onboarding process and initial server creation screen. A server represents your game server or community where radio stations will be hosted.

### Server Setup:

**Server Name**: Choose a memorable name for your server that your community will recognize. This could be your game server name, community name, or anything that helps you organize your stations.

<!-- **Server Logo**: Upload a logo for your server (optional). We recommend a 256x256px image, with a max file size of 5MB. -->

**Select Game**: Choose the platform where you'll primarily use SoundMesh:
- **FiveM** - For GTA V roleplay servers
- **Discord** - For Discord communities
- **Minecraft** - For Minecraft servers
- **Arma 3** - For Arma 3 servers

Don't worry about being locked into one platform! Your server and stations can be used across ANY integration - this selection just helps us optimize your initial setup.
