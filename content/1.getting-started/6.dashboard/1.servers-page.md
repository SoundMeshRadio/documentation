## Understanding Servers in SoundMesh

Servers are organizational containers for your radio stations. Think of them as folders that group related stations together - whether by game server, community, or project. Each server can host multiple radio stations while keeping everything neatly organized. One API key for all stations.

## Your Servers Overview

The My Servers page shows all your servers at a glance with key information:

- **Server Name** - Your chosen identifier
- **Status** - Active or Draft mode
- **Game Platform** - FiveM, Discord, Minecraft, etc.
- **Station Count** - Number of radio stations in this server

## Managing Your Servers

### Creating a New Server

Click the **"New Server"** button to:
1. Name your server
2. Select your primary game platform
3. Upload a server logo (optional)
4. Create your first station

::tip
Remember: Servers are just for organization! You can use stations from any server on any platform - a FiveM server's stations work perfectly on Discord too.

## Server Organization Strategies

### By Game Server
Most common approach - one SoundMesh server per game server:
- **"Los Santos RP"** - All stations for your FiveM server
- **"Survival Island"** - Stations for your Minecraft world
- **"Mil-Sim Operations"** - Radio stations for your Arma unit

### By Community
Perfect for multi-game communities:
- **"Gaming Clan Main"** - Stations used across all your games
- **"Event Radio"** - Special event broadcasting
- **"Member Radio"** - Community member stations

### By Purpose
Organize by function:
- **"Music Stations"** - All music-focused channels
- **"Talk Radio"** - Podcast and talk shows
- **"Emergency Broadcast"** - Alert and announcement stations


## Server Limits

Depending on your plan:

| Plan | Max Stations | Listeners per Station | Storage per Station |
|------|--------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| Aircheck (Free) | 1 | 10 | 250 MB |
| Core ($10) | 2 | 50 | 5 GB |
| Pro ($25) | 5 | 150 | 20 GB |
| Zeppelin ($50) | 10 | 300 | 50 GB |

::tip
Remember: These limits apply to EACH station! With Pro, all 5 of your stations can each have 150 concurrent listeners and 20GB of storage. Need more? Check out our [addons](/addons)!
