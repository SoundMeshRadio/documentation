## Expand Your Broadcasting Empire

As your community grows, so do your needs. Our flexible addon system lets you scale your SoundMesh experience without jumping to a whole new plan. This is helpful as plan changes are currently permenant. You can even use addons on our Free Plan (Aircheck). 

Pay only for what you need, when you need it.

### Current Plan Overview

Your dashboard shows your current resources at a glance:
- **Total Stations** - How many radio stations you can create
- **Total Listeners** - Concurrent listeners across all stations  
- **Total Storage** - Space for your music library and recordings
- **Monthly Cost** - Your current subscription total

## Storage Add-Ons

Build your music library without limits. Storage addons give you space for:
- Music collections and sound effects
- Recorded shows and podcasts
- Station jingles, IDs and ADs
- Emergency broadcast files

### Available Storage Tiers

| Storage | Songs* | Best For | Price |
|---------|--------|----------|-------|
| **+10GB** | ~3,000 songs | Small music collections | $3/month |
| **+25GB** | ~7,500 songs | Medium music libraries | $6/month |
| **+50GB** | ~15,000 songs | Large music collections | $10/month |
| **+100GB** | ~30,000+ songs | Massive music libraries | $15/month |

*Estimates based on average MP3 quality

::tip
Storage addons stack! Need 150GB? Just add multiple packages to get exactly what you need.
::
::warning
Storage addons apply to EACH station you own! If you have 5 stations and the +10GB addon, each station you own receives the extra 10GB!

## Listener Add-Ons

Growing audience? Fantastic! Scale your concurrent listener capacity to match your community's size.

### Available Listener Tiers

| Listeners | Use Case | Price |
|-----------|----------|-------|
| **+100 Listeners** | Growing servers | $5/month |
| **+250 Listeners** | Active DJs/events | $10/month |
| **+500 Listeners** | Mid-size community networks | $15/month |
| **+1000 Listeners** | Large-scale events | $25/month |
| **+2000 Listeners** | Partnered brands or big RP hubs | $45/month |

### Understanding Listener Counts

::warning
Listener addons apply to EACH station you own! If you have 5 stations and the 1000 listener addon, each station can support 1000 concurrent listeners. That's up to 5000 total listeners across your network!
::

- **Per-station capacity** - Each station gets the full listener count
- **Incredible scaling** - Multiple stations multiply your reach
- **Real-time monitoring** - Track listeners per station in your dashboard
- **No penalties** - If a station hits its limit, new listeners just can't connect to that station

## How Add-Ons Work

### Instant Activation
Add-ons activate immediately upon purchase. Listener addons might require a brodcast restart.

### Flexible Billing
- Add-ons are billed monthly with your base plan
- Add or remove anytime - limits removed at end of billing period
- No long-term commitments

### Smart Stacking
Mix and match add-ons to create your perfect setup:
- Running 3 stations? Add more storage for each DJ's library across all stations
- Big event coming? Temporarily boost listener capacity
- Seasonal changes? Scale up and down as needed

## Pro Tips

- **Start small** - You can always add more later
- **Plan for peaks** - Add listener capacity for special events
