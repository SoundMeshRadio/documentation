### For Players:

Players can use these commands:
- `/radio` - Open radio interface
- `/radiohud` - Toggle the miniHUD
- `/radiodrag` - If miniHUD is open, this enables the ability to reposition the UI
- `/smode` - Toggle Streamer Mode (turns off all radios for the user)

## Game Integration

### Vehicle Radios

SoundMesh automatically integrates with vehicle radios:

- Radio state syncs and persists when entering/exiting vehicles
- Only driver and front seat passenger can control vehicle radio
- Volume adjusts based on sitting inside or standing outside vehicle
- Hear radios from multiple vehicles while on foot with distance-based volume


<!-- ### Location-Based Audio

Create audio zones for businesses:

```lua [example_nightclub.lua]
-- Add to your nightclub script
exports['soundmesh']:CreateAudioZone({
    name = "Galaxy Nightclub",
    coords = vector3(195.2, -3170.0, 5.8),
    radius = 30.0,
    station = "galaxy_nightclub_radio",
    volume = 0.8
})
``` -->

<!-- ### Event Triggers

React to in-game events:

```lua [example_events.lua]
-- Change all radios during server events
TriggerEvent('soundmesh:override', {
    station = 'emergency_broadcast',
    duration = 300, -- 5 minutes
    priority = true
})

-- Play audio for specific player
TriggerClientEvent('soundmesh:playSound', playerId, {
    sound = 'notification',
    volume = 0.5
})
``` -->
