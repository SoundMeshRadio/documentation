### Common Issues:

**No audio playing:**
- Check your API key is valid
- Open the HUD, is a station playing?
- Do you have the in-game radio audio muted?

**Radio Metadata seems off:**
- Make sure the content you upload has good metadata

::tip
We reccomend using MP3TAG to bulk edit music metadata before uploading
