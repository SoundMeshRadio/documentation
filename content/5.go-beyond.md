><u>Imagine this</u>: A player driving down vinewood listening to your communites actual radio with real personalities creating live shows and experiences that become part of your server's culture. 

Your community can:

- Host morning shows with news and weather for your RP city
- Run late-night jazz stations for the night owls
- Create faction-specific stations with their own style
- Have DJ battles and live events
- Build actual radio careers within your game


## Built for Immersion

We built SoundMesh because we were sick of seeing the same old YouTube music scripts/bots. Real cities have radio. Real communities have DJs. Why shouldn't yours?
